In this project, I created a browser-based sketchpad, similar to an Etch-A-Sketch, to flex my DOM manipulation skills. The project was challenging, and I had to Google frequently to find the right JavaScript methods and CSS techniques. The goal was to apply the tools and knowledge I already have, while also exploring new resources as needed. Basic steps were provided, but I implemented them myself.
